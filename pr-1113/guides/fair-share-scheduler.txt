If the group has more than one project, and both have jobs waiting to be executed, then the scheduler identifies the project that has used the least of their share within the scheduling window. Finally, if the project has submitted more than one job, the scheduler will select the oldest job first. Thus, within a project, the scheduler works on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis.","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}],"\n",[["$","hr",null,{"className":"mt-48 lg:mt-64 mb-16 md:mb-24 my-16 lg:my-24 border-t border-border-subtle box-content overflow-visible"}],["$","h2",null,{"id":"wait-time-estimate","className":"group relative mx-0 scroll-pt-[var(--shell-top-bar-height)] break-words text-fluid-heading-04 text-text-primary","children":["Wait-time estimate",["$","a",null,{"title":"Permalink to this headline","children":["$","svg",null,{"focusable":"false","preserveAspectRatio":"xMidYMid meet","fill":"currentColor","width":16,"height":16,"viewBox":"0 0 32 32","aria-hidden":true,"className":"inline","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","children":["$16","$18","$undefined"]}],"href":"#wait-time-estimate","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline bg-transparent inline heading-permalink pl-[8px] top-0 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-[opacity] duration-75 ease-[cubic-bezier(0.2,0,0.38,0.9)]"}]]}]],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"A wait-time estimate is provided through IBM Quantum Platform and via Qiskit. The computed time is the result of a scheduling simulation that predicts one possible execution pattern, given the current fair-share ordering of all the jobs waiting for that system and the approximate runtime of each job. The dynamic nature of the fair-share scheduler means that this estimated time is not fixed and can vary, sometimes dramatically. This wait time is also subject to limitations inherent in estimating the execution time for Qiskit Runtime jobs. For these jobs, where an accurate estimation of time is not feasible, the maximum allowed runtime is used as a proxy. In practice, this means that the duration for a Qiskit Runtime job can be over-estimated by up to eight hours, the maximum allowed Qiskit Runtime job duration for Premium Plan users.","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["Your job’s position in the queue is listed in the ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"Queue position"}]," column on the ",["$","a",null,{"children":["Jobs page",["$","span",null,{"className":"sr-only","children":"(opens in a new tab)"}],false],"href":"https://quantum.ibm.com/jobs","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline bg-transparent inline","target":"_blank"}],"."],"className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}],"\n",[["$","hr",null,{"className":"mt-48 lg:mt-64 mb-16 md:mb-24 my-16 lg:my-24 border-t border-border-subtle box-content overflow-visible"}],["$","h2",null,{"id":"next-steps","className":"group relative mx-0 scroll-pt-[var(--shell-top-bar-height)] break-words text-fluid-heading-04 text-text-primary","children":["Next steps",["$","a",null,{"title":"Permalink to this headline","children":["$","svg",null,{"focusable":"false","preserveAspectRatio":"xMidYMid meet","fill":"currentColor","width":16,"height":16,"viewBox":"0 0 32 32","aria-hidden":true,"className":"inline","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","children":["$16","$18","$undefined"]}],"href":"#next-steps","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline bg-transparent inline heading-permalink pl-[8px] top-0 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-[opacity] duration-75 ease-[cubic-bezier(0.2,0,0.38,0.9)]"}]]}]],"\n",["$","div",null,{"className":"rounded border border-solid border-layer-02 not-prose my-12 lg:my-16","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-layer-02 text-text-primary font-600 p-12 py-8 flex items-center gap-8","children":[["$","svg",null,{"focusable":"false","preserveAspectRatio":"xMidYMid meet","fill":"currentColor","width":16,"height":16,"viewBox":"0 0 32 32","aria-hidden":true,"className":"text-purple-50","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","children":[["$","path",null,{"d":"M11 24H21V26H11zM13 28H19V30H13zM16 2A10 10 0 006 12a9.19 9.19 0 003.46 7.62c1 .93 1.54 1.46 1.54 2.38h2c0-1.84-1.11-2.87-2.19-3.86A7.2 7.2 0 018 12a8 8 0 0116 0 7.2 7.2 0 01-2.82 6.14c-1.07 1-2.18 2-2.18 3.86h2c0-.92.53-1.45 1.54-2.39A9.18 9.18 0 0026 12 10 10 0 0016 2z"}],"$undefined"]}],"Recommendations"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"px-12 [&>p]:my-12","children":["$","ul",null,{"children":["\n",["$","li",null,{"children":["Try the ",["$","a",null,{"children":["Grover's algorithm",["$","span",null,{"className":"sr-only","children":"(opens in a new tab)"}],false],"href":"https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/tutorial/grovers-algorithm","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline bg-transparent inline","target":"_blank"}]," tutorial."],"className":"my-12"}],"\n",["$","li",null,{"children":["Learn how to ",["$","$L15",null,{"children":"Monitor a job","href":"/guides/monitor-job","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline bg-transparent inline"}],"."],"className":"my-12"}],"\n"],"className":"list-outside ml-16 px-16 list-disc"}]}]]}]]}]}],["$","aside",null,{"data-testid":"page-toc","className":"hidden lg:flex flex-col gap-40 w-[184px] xlg:w-[207px] mr-24 xlg:mr-32 sticky top-[var(--app-header-height)] self-start py-24","style":{"marginTop":"40px","maxHeight":"calc(100vh - var(--app-header-height) - 40px)"},"children":["$","$L1b",null,{"headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"Fair-share scheduler","compiledValue":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {jsx: _jsx} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    div: \"div\"\n  }, props.components);\n  return _jsx(_components.div, {\n    children: \"Fair-share scheduler\"\n  });\n}\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = props.components || ({});\n  return MDXLayout ?
