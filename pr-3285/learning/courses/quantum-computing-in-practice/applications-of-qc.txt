Some problems can easily be solved on a classical computer, and we have no need for a quantum computer to solve them. On the other hand, there are very hard problems for which quantum computers are necessary to solve. One famous example is finding the prime factors of enormous integers. RSA encryption relies on the difficulty of this problem, and Shor's algorithm was designed to solve it on a quantum computer. Another example is finding a solution in an unsorted data set – this can theoretically be solved by the quantum algorithm known as Grover's algorithm.

This is a big problem because the slower we must evolve things, the more time we have for errors to occur. Counterdiabatic driving (CD) aims to combat this by adding terms that counteract these unwanted excitations. The main idea here is to speed up the whole experiment and reduce the quantum circuit depth by suppressing excitations that could cause spurious transitions.","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0 has-[span.katex]:overflow-x-auto has-[span.katex]:overflow-y-hidden"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Now for the other piece of jargon in the title: the bias field. Other iterative algorithms, like VQE, take classical parameters into the states and use classical optimizers to search the many-dimensional parameter space for the set of parameters that yields a minimum expectation value for a fixed Hamiltonian. In this case, they instead vary the Hamiltonian each time, moving adiabatically from a known case to the case of interest. To change the Hamiltonian, they simply directly apply the Pauli-Z expectation value from one iteration as a bias field in the Hamiltonian for the next iteration. In this way, they steer the dynamics toward the actual solution without the need for classical optimizers.","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0 has-[span.katex]:overflow-x-auto has-[span.katex]:overflow-y-hidden"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"So, why is this experiment of interest?

They compare idealized classical simulation results from DCQO and BF-DCQO, as well as the experimental result run on the quantum computer. They also show the result from a classical solver called Gurobi as a reference. With just 10 iterations, BF-DCQO provides a drastic enhancement compared to DCQO. Although the experimental result is a bit different than the ideal result due to noise, the performance is still better than the ideal DCQO. This shows that there is still a lot of excellent progress being made with regards to quantum optimization and good results are being reported on over 100 qubits for one of the first times.","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0 has-[span.katex]:overflow-x-auto has-[span.katex]:overflow-y-hidden"}],"\n",["$","$L18",null,{"src":"/documentation/pr-3285/learning/images/courses/quantum-computing-in-practice/applications-of-qc/paper_results.avif","alt":"Results from Ising spin-glass paper","width":"976","height":"682"}],"\n",["$","h3",null,{"id":"use-case-3-mrna-secondary-structure-prediction","className":"group relative mx-0 scroll-pt-[var(--shell-top-bar-height)] break-words text-heading-03 text-text-primary","children":["Use Case 3: mRNA secondary structure prediction",["$","a",null,{"title":"Permalink to this headline","children":["$","svg",null,{"focusable":"false","preserveAspectRatio":"xMidYMid meet","fill":"currentColor","width":16,"height":16,"viewBox":"0 0 32 32","aria-hidden":true,"className":"inline","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","children":["$14","$16","$undefined"]}],"href":"#use-case-3-mrna-secondary-structure-prediction","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline inline heading-permalink pl-[8px] top-0 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-[opacity] duration-75 ease-[cubic-bezier(0.2,0,0.38,0.9)]"}]]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["Finally, we'll discuss a paper from Moderna Pharmaceuticals called ",["$","a",null,{"children":["mRNA Secondary Structure Prediction Using Utility-Scale Quantum Computers",["$","svg",null,{"focusable":"false","preserveAspectRatio":"xMidYMid meet","fill":"currentColor","aria-label":"(opens in a new tab)","width":16,"height":16,"viewBox":"0 0 32 32","role":"img","className":"inline ml-2","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","children":["$19","$undefined"]}]],"href":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20328","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline inline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener nofollow noreferrer"}],"."],"className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0 has-[span.katex]:overflow-x-auto has-[span.katex]:overflow-y-hidden"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"First, a brief refresher on mRNA.

The image below shows some common folding structures found in mRNA, each color represents a different type of secondary structure.
